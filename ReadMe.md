Neural Network Training Program
-------------------------------

This program demonstrates the training of a feedforward neural network using backpropagation.

### Usage:

1. Prepare Training Data:
   - Create a text file containing training data in the following format:
     - Each line should start with "in:" followed by input values separated by spaces.
     - Each line should also contain "out:" followed by target output values separated by spaces.
     - Example:
       ```
       in: 0.0 0.0
       out: 1.0
       in: 0.0 1.0
       out: 0.0
       ...
       ```

2. Compile the Program:
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

3. Run the Program:
- Execute the program with the path to your training data file as a command-line argument:


4. Training:
- The program will read the training data, train the neural network, and display the progress.

5. Output:
- The program will output the network's predictions and error during training.

6. Customize:
- You can customize the neural network's topology and training parameters in the code.

### Requirements:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Training data in the specified format
